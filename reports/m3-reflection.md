# Milestone 3 Reflection

## Addressing Feedback

- Adjusted the layout to ensure all UI components fit on a single page.

- Added a title to the dashboard.

- Enhanced the scatter plot by incorporating additional color and size encodings to better highlight differences in the number of units.

- Updated the pie chart to use the same color encoding as the scatter plot for consistency.

- Aligned the icons on the map with the same color encoding as the bar chart.

- Introduced a toggle option for a logarithmic scale on the scatter plot.

## Additional Improvements

- Split the code into separate files for improved organization and maintainability.

- Arranged the UI components using Dash Bootstrap Components (dbc) card components for a cleaner layout.

## Improvements Not Implemented

- The global gridding of property value and rental issues from the original sketch has not been implemented.
Since this would take extensive time to implement and overlay onto our map, we do not plan on implementing this feature.

## Further Improvements

- Since our current scope is limited to Vancouver, I suggest restricting the map to display only Vancouver and disabling the ability to zoom out to the entire world.
